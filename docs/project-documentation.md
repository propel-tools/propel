# Team Management Platform Documentation

## Overview

The Team Management Platform is a comprehensive solution for managing teams, members, roles, and badges within an organization. It supports multi-tenancy, allowing multiple organizations to use the platform with complete data isolation. The platform also includes directory synchronization capabilities with LDAP and Google Workspace.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: API Key, JWT (for user authentication)
- **Directory Integration**: LDAP, Google Workspace API

### System Components

1. **Core Application**
   - Team management
   - Member management
   - Badge and achievement system
   - Role-based access control

2. **Multi-Tenant System**
   - Tenant isolation
   - Tenant-specific configurations
   - API key authentication

3. **Directory Synchronization**
   - LDAP integration
   - Google Workspace integration
   - Scheduled synchronization
   - Manual synchronization

### Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support multi-tenancy with the following key models:

- **Tenant**: Represents an organization using the platform
- **Team**: Groups of members within a tenant
- **Member**: Individual users within teams
- **Badge**: Achievements that can be awarded to members
- **MemberBadge**: Association between members and badges
- **SyncConfig**: Configuration for directory synchronization

## Features

- Tenant-specific configurations
- Custom branding per tenant
- API key authentication

### Directory Synchronization

- Automatic user import from LDAP
- Automatic user import from Google Workspace
- Scheduled synchronization
- Manual synchronization
- Mapping of directory attributes to member properties

## API Reference

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using one of the following methods:

- **API Key**: Include the `x-api-key` header with the tenant's API key
- **Tenant ID**: Include the `x-tenant-id` header with the tenant's ID

### Endpoints

#### Teams

- `GET /api/teams` - Get all teams
- `GET /api/teams/:id` - Get a specific team
- `POST /api/teams` - Create a new team
- `PUT /api/teams/:id` - Update a team
- `DELETE /api/teams/:id` - Delete a team
- `GET /api/teams/:id/members` - Get all members of a team

#### Members

- `GET /api/members` - Get all members
- `GET /api/members/:id` - Get a specific member
- `POST /api/members` - Create a new member
- `PUT /api/members/:id` - Update a member
- `DELETE /api/members/:id` - Delete a member
- `GET /api/members/:id/badges` - Get all badges for a member
- `POST /api/members/:id/badges` - Assign a badge to a member
- `DELETE /api/members/:id/badges/:badgeId` - Remove a badge from a member

#### Badges

- `GET /api/badges` - Get all badges
- `GET /api/badges/:id` - Get a specific badge
- `POST /api/badges` - Create a new badge
- `PUT /api/badges/:id` - Update a badge
- `DELETE /api/badges/:id` - Delete a badge

#### Directory Synchronization

- `GET /api/admin/sync-config` - Get sync configurations
- `POST /api/admin/sync-config` - Create a new sync configuration
- `GET /api/admin/sync-config/:id` - Get a specific sync configuration
- `PUT /api/admin/sync-config/:id` - Update a sync configuration
- `DELETE /api/admin/sync-config/:id` - Delete a sync configuration
- `POST /api/admin/sync` - Trigger directory synchronization

#### Tenant Management

- `GET /api/admin/tenants` - Get all tenants
- `POST /api/admin/tenants` - Create a new tenant
- `GET /api/admin/tenants/:id` - Get a specific tenant
- `PUT /api/admin/tenants/:id` - Update a tenant
- `DELETE /api/admin/tenants/:id` - Delete a tenant

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Isolation**: Each tenant's data is completely isolated from other tenants
2. **API Authentication**: All API requests require authentication
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Users have different permissions based on their roles
4. **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
5. **HTTPS**: All API requests should be made over HTTPS
6. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
8. **SQL Injection Protection**: Prisma ORM provides protection against SQL injection

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Connection Pooling**: Database connection pooling for better performance
3. **Caching**: API response caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Pagination**: Pagination for large data sets
5. **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database queries using Prisma
6. **Asynchronous Processing**: Directory synchronization runs asynchronously

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **API Logs**: Detailed logs of API requests and responses
2. **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
3. **Performance Metrics**: Monitoring of API performance and database queries
4. **Sync Logs**: Detailed logs of directory synchronization processes
5. **Audit Logs**: Tracking of important system events and changes

## Extensibility

The platform is designed to be extensible with the following capabilities:

1. **Custom Badges**: Create custom badges and achievements
2. **Custom Roles**: Define custom roles with specific permissions
3. **Integration Points**: APIs for integration with other systems
4. **Webhooks**: Event-based webhooks for external integrations
5. **Custom Fields**: Support for custom fields on members and teams
